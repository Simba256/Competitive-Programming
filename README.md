**Repository Name:** Competitive-Programming

**Description:**
Greetings, fellow coding enthusiasts! üöÄ This is my Competitive Programming Attempts repository, a space where I share the journey of tackling coding challenges from various platforms, including Codeforces, Advent of Code, and ICPC. As a dedicated Computer Science student at GIKI, class of 2025, and proud to represent Pakistan in the upcoming ICPC World Finals in Egypt, I've decided to showcase not just the successes but the entire spectrum of attempts.

**What's Inside:**
- A candid compilation of both correct and incorrect solutions to problems from Codeforces, Advent of Code, and ICPC.
- Organized folders categorizing attempts based on contest platforms and years, providing a comprehensive view of my progress.
- In-depth commentary on code, detailing the logic and thought process behind each attempt.
- Embracing the learning curve ‚Äì from initial struggles to triumphant solutions.

**Why Explore:**
This repository offers a transparent look into the learning process of a competitive programmer. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting your journey, you'll find value in understanding the challenges, failures, and successes that contribute to growth.

**Connect with Me:**
