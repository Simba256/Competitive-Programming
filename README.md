**Greetings, fellow coding enthusiasts!** üöÄ  
Welcome to my Competitive Programming Attempts repository, a showcase of my journey tackling coding challenges across various platforms, including Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, CSES.fi, Project Euler, Advent of Code, and the prestigious ICPC.  

As a Computer Science student at GIKI (Class of 2025) and a **2-time ICPC World Finalist** (Honourable Mention at both the 2023 Finals in Luxor, Egypt, and the 2024 Finals in Astana, Kazakhstan), I‚Äôm excited to share not just my successes but the full spectrum of my attempts in competitive programming.

### **What's Inside:**
- A comprehensive collection of correct and incorrect solutions from platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, CSES.fi, and ICPC contests.
- Structured folders organized by contest platform and year, providing insight into my competitive programming evolution.
- Detailed commentary on my code, explaining the logic and problem-solving techniques behind each attempt.
- Embracing the learning process, from initial challenges to ultimate solutions.

### **Why Explore:**
This repository offers a transparent look into the growth of a competitive programmer. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, you‚Äôll find valuable insights into the hurdles, setbacks, and victories that shape improvement in competitive programming.
